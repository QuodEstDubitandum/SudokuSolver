# Sudoku Solver

Implemented a small Sudoku Solver that gets a CSV file as input und outputs the solved Sudoku as CSV file.  
The input CSV file should contain the rows of the Sudoku as coresponding rows in the file.  
Your input should therefore contain 9 rows with 9 values in each row.  
Set values that are missing in the input Sudoku to 0.  
I provided an input and the coresponding output file as an example in my repository.

## Future Plans 

Somewhere in the unforeseeable future I will try to implement a ML model that is able to recognize the 
input Sudoku just from a picture making it easier for the user by not forcing him to input 81 values into a CSV 
file just to solve the Sudoku.
